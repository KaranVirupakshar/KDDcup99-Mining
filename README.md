# KDDcup99-Mining
Software to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from unauthorized users, including perhaps insiders. The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections. Hence KDD Cup 99 dataset was created as a part of annual data mining competition in the year 1999. Our GOAL is to predict if a connection is safe or an anamoly.
